# display-ads-blocklist
A list of terrible / spammy domains to add to your display ads blocklist.

## What is this repo?
Many independent web publishers monetise their websites with _display ads_. Since most publishers don't sell their "inventory" (ad space) to advertisers directly, and instead offer it for sale through third parties (like Google), they don't have much control over who their ad space is sold to. 

The controls available to publishers, in tools like Google AdSense, are extremely poor. Publishers don't have the opportunity to approve or reject ads before they run. 

There is concern about brands feeling safe enough to run their own ads on a blog, but there is little power for publishers to exercise their own control.

As a result, there are sometimes crappy and spammy ads running on my blog.

This is terrible for both users and publishers:

- It makes for a shitty experience for users: _"this advert is trying to scam me"_

- It destroys the value of the brands that we spend time building -- _"this website doesn't care if it runs shitty ads"_

## What's inside this repo?
This repo holds a text file with a list of 'spammy' (at best) and harmful (at worst) websites which have been allowed to run ads via Google's display network. Or perhaps some other intermediary.

I am updating this list whenever I see an ad on the web which links through to websites like:

- Misleading/fradulent subscription services - e.g. for 'digital downloads', 'manuals', etc.
- 'Download Now' "big green button" type ads with no information - designed to trick you into clicking
- Generic content spam

## How to use this repo?
If you want to block unappealing ads from your blog, feel free to take the domains in this text file and add them into your ad network's blocklist page. The instructions vary for each network so I can't list them all here.

## Can I contribute?
Sure, please make a pull request. At this stage I'll review requests manually.
